/**
 * An example of using the hardhat-zksync plugin to deploy smart contracts.
 *  1. Deploys the MyContractFactory contract.
 *    - Since the factory can also deploy the MyContract contract, it also requires the bytecode of the MyContract contract in factoryDeps.
 *    - However, the zksolc compiler detects it automatically, and populates it in the factoryDeps field of the factory artifact.
 *       - See the /artifacts-zk/contracts/MyContractFactory.sol/MyContractFactory.json - factoryDeps field.
 *    - The Deployer from @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync reads this and includes the factoryDeps in the EIP-712 deployment transaction.
 * 
 *  2. Using the factory, deploy an new instance of MyContract via the 4 different methods.
