/**
 * An example of using the hardhat-zksync plugin to deploy smart contracts.
 *  1. Deploys the AccountFactory contract.
 *    - Since the factory can also deploy the Account contract, it also requires the bytecode of the Account contract in factoryDeps.
 *    - Because the Account contract is not explicitly deployed in the factory code, we need to manually provide it
 *        in the factoryDeps field when we go to deploy the factory contract.
 * 
 *  2. Using the factory, deploy an new instance of Account via the 2 different methods.
