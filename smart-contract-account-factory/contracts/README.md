## Smart Contract Account Factory Contracts

See [the root README](../README.md) for an overview of the project.

This is the setup instructions for the smart contracts of this repository.

1. Compiling the contracts.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Create a new [Hardhat configuration variable](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables) for your wallet private key.

   When prompted, enter the private key of the wallet you want to use to deploy the contract.
   It is strongly recommended to use a new wallet for this purpose.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat vars set WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
   ```

3. Run the [deploy script](./contracts/deploy/deploy.ts) to deploy the smart contract account factory and create a smart account via the factory.

   _Note: The `defaultNetwork` inside [hardhat.config.ts](./contracts/hardhat.config.ts) is set to `abstractTestnet`. You will need [testnet ETH from a faucet](https://docs.abs.xyz/ecosystem/faucets) in your wallet to deploy the contract to Abstract._

   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
   ```

If successful, this will print something like this:

```

```

### Using a local node with Docker

To deploy onto a local node (instead of the Abstract testnet), follow the instructions below.

1. Install the ZKsync CLI

   ```bash
   npm install -g zksync-cli
   ```

2. For local development, ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed and running.

   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker info
   ```

3. For local development, run an "In Memory node".

   ```bash
   zksync-cli dev start
   ```

4. Set the hardhat default network to `inMemoryNode` in [hardhat.config.ts](./hardhat.config.ts).

   ```typescript
   defaultNetwork: "inMemoryNode",
   ```

5. Use the [rich wallets](https://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node#pre-configured-rich-wallets) to access accounts loaded with funds on the local node.
